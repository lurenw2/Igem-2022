      <h4>Silver Medal Criterion #3</h4>
      <p>Explain how you have determined your work is responsible and good for the world. Talking with Professor Mulvaney 
Dr. Mulvaney is a professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign whose research focuses on reducing the negative effects of nitrate fertilizers by improving nitrogen uptake in crops. We talked to Dr. Mulvaney in order to learn more about the source of nitrate N loss, the extent of its environmental impacts, and the challenges of addressing this global issue.

Dr. Mulvaney confirmed that the overuse of chemical nitrogen fertilizers (CNF) is the primary source of nitrogen (N) pollution. Part of this excess usage stems from caution - in order for farmers to avoid low crop yields, they are recommended to add enough fertilizer for 1.2 times their expected yield. However, it has been found that adding more N [causes more harm than good]. Based on research done from our school’s Morrow Plots, [have a citation here prob] it seems that natural soil fertility decreased with the addition of CNF. [elaborate?] This creates a cycle of excess CNF usage - less fertile soil creates lower yields, pushing farmers to add more CNF to increase yields. 
( too much fertilizer to increase yield, ammonia N fertilizer - major N fertilizer - became extremely popular after WW2, “propaganda” of fertilizer, Haber-Boch “addiction”)

We also talked to Dr. Mulvaney about how N pollution affects local communities. He directed our attention to Illinois’ Lake Decatur.  [maybe have lake Decatur as separate section?]
 (Environmental impacts - losing natural soil fertility (more fertilized areas had less fertile soil, ironically), Decatur and Des Moines)

When asked about the greatest challenge facing the prevention of N pollution, Dr. Mulvaney cited the profit-motivated interests of the fertilizer industry. [WW2 background?] Despite all the 
(Challenges - fertilizer industry false advertisement in order to make money, motivated by profit, believes that the best solution is to stop the use of CNF altogether.)

Lake Decatur
After meeting with Professor Mulvaney, we decided to do independent research about how N pollution is affecting local communities.

      <h4>Best Integrated Human Practices Special Prize</h4>
      <p>To compete for the this prize, please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the <a href="https://competition.igem.org/deliverables/judging-form">judging form</a>.</p>
      <p>How does your project affect society and how does society influence the direction of your project? How might ethical considerations and stakeholder input guide your project purpose and design and the experiments you conduct in the lab? How does this feedback enter into the process of your work all through the iGEM competition? Document a thoughtful and creative approach to exploring these questions and how your project evolved in the process to compete for this award!</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>At iGEM we believe societal considerations should be upfront and integrated throughout the design and execution of synthetic biology projects. “Human Practices” refers to iGEM teams' efforts to actively consider how the world affects their work and their work affects the world. Through your Human Practices activities, your team should demonstrate how you have thought carefully and creatively about whether your project is responsible and good for the world. We invite you to explore issues relating (but not limited) to the ethics, safety, security, and sustainability of your project, and to show how this exploration feeds back into your project purpose, design, and execution.</p>
    <p>Please note you can compete for the Silver Medal criterion #3, Gold Medal criterion #1 and the Best Integrated Human Practices prize with this page.</p>
    <p>For more information, please see the <a href="https://responsibility.igem.org/human-practices/what-is-human-practices">Human Practices Hub</a>.
    <p>On this page, your team should document all of your Human Practices work and activities. You should write about the Human Practices topics you considered in your project, document any activities you conducted to explore these topics (such as engaging with experts and stakeholders), describe why you took a particular approach (including referencing any work you built upon), and explain if and how you integrated takeaways from your Human Practices work back into your project purpose, design and/or execution.</p>
